# VU-MachineLearning-Project

As part of the Machine Learning course of the VU University in Amsterdam, students are encouraged to obtain a good understanding of machine-learning models. To do this, a Random Forest model has been developed from scratch. Using only the Pandas and Numpy Python packages, a working Random Forest model has been developed. The developed Random Forest model was trained, validated and tested on the MNIST data set. The future research includesreducing the computation time, testing on data set with numeric and categorical features as well ascreating Random Forest models with a larger number of features and Decision Tree models.

Files:
- Report.pdf results of our research and calculations
- Mnist-data.zip the training and testing data of Mnist as CSV, unzip this first
- Code/Program.py how to call the RandomForest and DecisionTree
- Code/RandomForest.py algorithm for RandomForest, needs DecisionTree.py uncomment line 9 to reproduce the exact same results as our report
- Code/DecisionTree.py algorithm for DecisionTree
- Results.csv the results of the calculations we ran with our algorithm and with sklearn RandomForestClassifier
